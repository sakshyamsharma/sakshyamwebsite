<p><b>SOME INFORMATION ABOUT Operating System</b></p>
<p>An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by
 a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs
make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program
interface (API).An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.

The dominant general-purpose personal computer operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 76.45%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (17.72%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.73%). In the mobile sector (including smartphones and tablets), Android's share is up to 72% in the year 2020. According to third quarter 2016 data, Android's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent. Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems (special-purpose operating systems),such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements (e.g. light-weight Linux distribution). Others may have higher system requirements.

Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with purchased computers (OEM-installation), whereas others may run directly from media (i.e. live CD) or flash memory (i.e. USB stick).

<p><b>History Of Operating System</b></p>
<p>1.)Operating systems were first developed in the late 1950s to manage tape storage</p>
<p>2.)The General Motors Research Lab implemented the first OS in the early 1950s for their IBM 701</p>
<p>3.)In the mid-1960s, operating systems started to use disks</p>
<p>4.)In the late 1960s, the first version of the Unix OS was developed</p>
<p>5.)The first OS built by Microsoft was DOS. It was built in 1981 by purchasing the 86-DOS software from a Seattle company</p>
<p>6.)The present-day popular OS Windows first came to existence in 1985 when a GUI was created and paired with MS-DOS.</p>

<p><b>Types of Operating System (OS)</b></p>
<p>Following are the popular types of OS (Operating System):</p>
<p>Batch Operating System</p>
<p>Multitasking/Time Sharing OS</p>
<p>Multiprocessing OS</p>
<p>Real Time OS</p>
<p>Distributed OS</p>
<p>Network OS</p>
<p>Mobile OS</p>
<p><b>Batch Operating System</b></p>
<p>Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming. To speed the same process, a job with a similar type of needs are batched together and run as a group.

The user of a batch operating system never directly interacts with the computer. In this type of OS, every user prepares his or her job on an offline device like a punch card and submit it to the computer operator.</p>
<p><b>Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems</b></p>
<p>Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time. The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing.</p>
<p><b>Real time Operating System</b></p>
<p>A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems are the Real time OS example.
</p>
<p><b>Distributed Operating System</b></p>
<p>Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its users.</p>
<p><b>Network Operating System</b></p>
<p>Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.</p>
<p><b>Mobile OS</b></p>
<p>Mobile operating systems are those OS which is especially that are designed to power smartphones, tablets, and wearables devices.

Some most famous mobile operating systems are Android and iOS, but others include BlackBerry, Web, and watchOS.</p>
